## Data-driven Credit Risk Analysis and Loan Approval Optimization

In this project, I conducted an extensive analysis of credit risk factors using the application data from a financial institution. The goal was to optimize the loan approval process and reduce default rates. Here's a summary of the project:

### Project Overview:
I analyzed a vast dataset containing information about loan applicants, focusing on key factors influencing credit risk. The project involved data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, and univariate analysis to derive actionable insights for the financial institution.

**Data Cleaning and Exploration:**

-Null Value Handling: Columns with more than 40% null values were dropped to enhance data quality.
-Flag Column Analysis: Columns starting with "FLAG_" were analyzed. Correlation analysis helped identify and drop irrelevant columns.
-Feature Engineering: New features were created, including binning for income and goods price, and categorization of employment and age ranges.
**Feature Insights:**

1 Loan Type Analysis:

-Cash Loans: Safest loan type with an 8% default rate.
2 Demographic Factors:

-Gender: Females exhibited a lower default rate of 6%.
-Family Status: Applicants with family connections showed a default rate below 8%.
-Education: Higher education levels correlated with a default rate of less than 6%. Academic backgrounds had the lowest default rate, indicating potential for targeted promotions.
3 Marital and Housing Status:

-Marriage: Married individuals had a default rate of less than 8%, making them preferable candidates.
-Housing: Those with their own houses/apartments displayed a default rate below 8%.

4 Occupation Impact:

-Professions: Pensioners exhibited the lowest default rate, followed by state servants and commercial associates.
-Job Roles: Certain roles like drivers and sales staff had higher default rates, while managers and accountants had a lower rate (<7.5%).

**Conclusion:**
This analysis provided actionable insights for the financial institution. By focusing on applicants fitting specific profiles (such as married individuals with higher education and stable professions), the institution can optimize its loan approval process, reduce defaults, and improve overall portfolio quality

**Key Takeaways for Business:**

-Targeted Marketing: Promotions and marketing efforts can be tailored for specific demographic and professional groups identified as low-risk borrowers.
-Risk Mitigation: By avoiding riskier categories (like certain job roles), the institution can proactively reduce default rates.
-Improved Decision Making: Data-driven insights can guide loan approval decisions, enhancing the institution's overall lending strategy.
